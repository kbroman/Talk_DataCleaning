## Data cleaning principles

### fundamentals

1. Don't clean data when tired or hungry
2. Don’t trust anyone (even yourself)
3. Think about what might have gone wrong and how it might be revealed
4. Use care in merging: Focus on labels not position
5. Dates and categories suck

### verify

6. Check that distinct things are distinct
7. Check that matching data do match
8. Double-check calculations
9. If you find a problem, look for other instances of the problem

### explore

10. Plot stuff: vs time, and scatterplots
11. Look at missing data patterns
12. With massive datasets, make more plots not fewer
13. If you see something weird, figure out why

### ask

14. Don’t be shy about asking questions
15. Ask for the primary data
16. Ask for metadata
17. Ask why data are missing

### document

18. Create checklists and pipelines
19. Document not just what but why
20. Expect to recheck
