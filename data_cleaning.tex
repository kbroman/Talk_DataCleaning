    Data analysts spend a lot of time organizing and cleaning data,
    but few of us have been trained to do so. Why is that?

    Some say that data cleaning is difficult to generalize. But I
    think there are some general principles. Moreover, I think we have
    an important shared experience in data cleaning that we can
    commiserate about, and through which we can learn from each other.

Tidy data are all alike, \\[3pt]

is messy in its own way.

\note{
  Hadley's talking more about data organization than data
  cleanliness.  And his point is that if you make data tidy, it
  simplifies all the downstream analyses.

  But {\hilit is} every messy dataset {\vhilit uniquely} messy?

\note{
  In his discussion of David Donoho's paper about data science, Roger
  Peng spoke about how data cleaning is frustratingly difficult to
  generalize.

  But my answer to his question is {\vhilit absolutely!}

  A person with experience cleaning one dataset has important
  experience to draw upon when moving to another dataset even if it's
  of a totally different nature.

\note{
  In February, 2021, Caitlin Hudon and Laura Ellis organized an
  Friday evening conference where 16 people gave short presentations on data
  mishaps.

  Many of the stories concerned mistakes in data cleaning, and while these
  weren't necessarily the most amusing stories, they did seem to
  bring out a strong sense of shared experience. We have suffered
  and struggled through very similar data problems.

\note{
  Really, I think we don't usually teach data cleaning
  because it's something we prefer to keep private.

  We're shy about it.

  And data cleaning code is our ugliest code.

\note{
  I'm proposing a set of basic principles for data cleaning, and
  splitting them into five groups. There are some fundamental
  principles, followed by four basic ideas: verify things that you
  expect, explore to find further oddities, ask questions, and
  document what you've done.

\note{
  At her talk at the Data Mishaps night, Ghazal Gulati emphasized this
  point, of not cleaning data when you're tired or hungry.

  Data cleaning requires considerable concentration, and you need to
  allow sufficient time to do the work. If you're in a hurry, you'll
  miss things.

\note{
  Personally, I think this is the most important principle for data
  cleaning. It has been central in guiding my approach.

  I need a good figure for this.
