## pdfnup

Building the notes version of the slides needs `pdfnup`, which is a
bit complicated to obtain.

Previously it was available via [texlive](https://tug.org/texlive/),
but now I need to use [pdfjam](https://github.com/rrthomas/pdfjam)
plus the pdfnup script in the [pdfjam
extras](https://github.com/rrthomas/pdfjam-extras>).
