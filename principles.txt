fundamentals
1. “Don’t do data QC when tired, hungry, or thirsty” (or angry)
   - Ghazal Gulati, @ghazalgulati [Allocate sufficient time and energy]
2. Think about what might have gone wrong, and how it might be revealed
3. Don’t trust anyone (even yourself)
4. Use care in merging: Focus on labels not position (e.g. rows or columns get swapped)
5. Dates and categories suck

verify
6. Are the things that should be distinct actually distinct?
7. Are the things that should be consistent actually consistent?
8. Double-check calculations
9. If you find a problem, look for other instances of the problem

explore
10. Plot stuff: vs time, and scatterplots (e.g. batch differences)
11. Look at missing data patterns (e.g. subjects present in one file but missing from another)
12. Look for outliers (real variation or error?)
13. There will always be typos

confer
14. Don’t be shy about asking questions
15. Ask for the primary data (mistakes may have been made in the compiling)
    (look for odd rounding patterns)
16. Ask for metadata (easier to identify with variables that you understand)
17. "Yeah but why are they missing?" Ask about the nature of the missing data

document
18. Create checklists and pipelines: codify your experience
19. Data cleaning should be more than reproducible: document not just what but why
20. Expect to recheck
