## Draft transcript

1. Data analysts spend a lot of time cleaning data, but few of us have
   had any formal training. Why is that? Some say the process is
   difficult to generalize.

2. Hadley Wickham said "Tidy data are all alike, but every messy
   dataset is messy in its own way." He was talking about data
   structure rather than cleaning...that if data are in a consistent
   format, it simplifies all of the work downstream.

   But is every messy dataset uniquely messy?

   It's true that my collaborators show impressive creativity in their
   data handling processes. But we do all see many of the same kinds
   of problems, repeatedly.

3. In his discussion of David Donoho's paper about data science, Roger
   Peng asked "If I clean up Medicare data, does any of the knowledge
   I gain apply to the processing of RNA-seq data?"

   My response is: **absolutely**!

   The context certainly matters, but cleaning one dataset provides
   useful experience when confronted with the next one, even it's from
   a completely different discipline.

4. One of the best things to happen in the pandemic was Data Mishaps
   Night. 16 people gave 5 min talks about mistakes they'd made with
   data. Many concerned data cleaning, and I think we all felt a great
   closeness through our shared experience and struggles with data.

5. I think we're not teaching data cleaning because it's tedious, the
   results are often embarrassing, it needs context, and it often doesn't
   feel like progress.

   I mean, how many students are going to be excited to sign up for a
   course in data cleaning?

   But data cleaning also requires great creativity, our most advanced
   programming skills. And it's the source of most problems.

6. And so I'd like to propose a set of principles for data cleaning.
   I've split them up into 5 parts: some fundamental ideas, plus
   the four main pieces: verify, explore, ask, and document.
