Why don't we teach data cleaning? It has been said that it is difficult to generalize: that what we learn from cleaning Medicare data cannot be readily applied to the cleaning of RNA-seq data. To the contrary, I think there are important general principles for cleaning data, and there are more commonalities in the creative process of data cleaning than in other aspects of data analysis. I will seek to delineate and illustrate these principles, which include:

(1) think about what might have gone wrong and how it might be revealed
(2) study the pattern of missing data and ask why they are missing
(3) use care when merging datasets and focus on labels not position
(4) if things are supposed to match, check that they do
(5) if things are supposed to be distinct, check that they are
(6) look for outliers and other oddities by making lots of plots, particularly scatterplots
(7) look for batch effects by making lots of plots, particularly plots against time and scatterplots colored by batch
(8) ask for the primary data and also metadata
(9) don’t be shy about asking questions
(10) document not just what you did but also why you did it
(11) don’t trust anyone (even yourself)
(12) allocate sufficient time and energy to the effort
